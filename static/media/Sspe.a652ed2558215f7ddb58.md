# Building a Serverless Stream Processing Engine: A Deep Dive into Cloud Native Solutions

In the ever-evolving world of cloud computing, I recently embarked on an exciting journey alongside Professor Ma Tianbai at NUS. Our mission? To design and develop a cloud-native serverless stream processing engine, harnessing the power of Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) and the robust Kubernetes framework.

Collaborating with a team of dedicated PhD students, I've been immersed in the intricacies of running services in cloud environments. This experience has not only enriched my technical prowess but also offered invaluable insights into the nuances of academic research.

To lay a solid foundation, I began by acquainting myself with established stream processing engines, with Apache Flink standing out as a notable example. Grasping the underlying theories and principles of these engines such as exact-once processing and fault tolerance was crucial, ensuring I had a comprehensive understanding of the design and implementation nuances.

As our focus shifted to identifying potential open-source FaaS frameworks, I delved into Fission. This remarkable framework, built atop Kubernetes, caught our attention due to its seamless integration and utilization of Kubernetes' features. Fission's capabilities and adaptability made it a prime candidate for our project's requirements. To introduce this to the team, I made a presentation going over the potential of the framework and its inner workings.

However, the heart of my responsibility lay in crafting the orchestration layer of our engine. This demanded a deep understanding of Kubernetes, pushing me to explore its vast ecosystem. I ventured into the realm of custom controllers, leveraging Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to manipulate and manage resources. This hands-on experience with Kubernetes' extensibility and customization options was both challenging and rewarding.

As we continue to forge ahead, the project remains a work in progress. The anticipation builds with each step, and I eagerly await the culmination of our collective efforts. The journey thus far has been a testament to the power of collaboration, innovation, and the limitless possibilities of cloud-native solutions.
