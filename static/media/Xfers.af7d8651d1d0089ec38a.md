# Navigating the Blockchain In NUS FinTech Society: A Collaborative Endeavor with StraitsX
Between February and May of 2021, I had the privilege of spearheading a dynamic team of seven at the NUS FinTech society. Our mission was clear yet challenging: develop a website capable of analyzing blockchain transactions and assign a risk value based on intricate metrics derived from account histories. This ambitious project was undertaken in partnership with the Singaporean FinTech company, Xfers, now popularly known as StraitsX.

Our team was a blend of expertise and enthusiasm. Comprising four computer science undergrads and three students from the school of business, we combined our strengths to bring this project to fruition. The business students delved deep into the realm of blockchain, researching potential risk factors associated with transactions. On the other hand, we, the tech enthusiasts, rolled up our sleeves to craft a responsive website. Harnessing the power of HTML and CSS, and integrating API calls to Etherscan via Javascript, we ensured the site was both functional and user-friendly.

Collaboration was at the heart of our endeavor. Regular meetings with the Xfers liaison ensured we remained aligned with their vision and expectations. These interactions were invaluable, offering insights, feedback, and direction. Internally, task delegation was crucial. Recognizing the diverse skill sets and resources within our team, I meticulously assigned roles, ensuring each member could shine and contribute effectively.

Of course, our journey wasn't devoid of challenges. From bridging the skill gap among team members to navigating technical roadblocks, we faced our fair share of hurdles. Yet, with determination, collaboration, and a shared vision, we overcame each obstacle, learning and growing along the way.

Our efforts culminated in a successful project, a testament to our hard work and dedication. I'm proud to share that our results have been showcased on the StraitsX website.
